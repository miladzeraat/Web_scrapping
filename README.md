Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
This is a Python project developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project involves extracting and visualizing stock data using different sources.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages installed:

'pandas'
'yfinance'
'BeautifulSoup4'
'requests'
Usage
To run the project, open the Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the code cells.

The project consists of six sections, each corresponding to one of the questions listed in the project instructions. The sections are as follows:

Extracting Tesla Stock Data Using yfinance
Extracting Tesla Revenue Data Using Webscraping
Extracting GameStop Stock Data Using yfinance
Extracting GameStop Revenue Data Using Webscraping
